# openWeb
a distraction-free, sleek, and performance-first old school browser, built for daily and normal usage filled to the brim with fun easter eggs

# browse the web!
thats the purpose of this browser right? you can access most websites with ease! just type in the url, or just search it, and easily access the page with nothing else

# performance
it runs as fast as a usual modern browser, it plays youtube well, it can download files with ease, its just a modern browser but stripped to only the essentials so you can go about without clutter.

# notes
the HTML and JS files are for hosting the extensions. you can browse the extension's source code by: https://auth1ery.github.io/openWeb/
anything else is for the actual browser itself
